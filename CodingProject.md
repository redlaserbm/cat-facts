# 🐱 Cat Fact Tracker – New Hire Intro Project

Welcome! This project is a small full-stack application to help you get comfortable with the technologies we use and to evaluate your skills in a real-world scenario.

You’ll build a backend with FastAPI, a local SQLite database, a Python script that fetches cat facts from an external API, and a React frontend to interact with your backend.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a simple app that:
- Pulls random cat facts from [https://catfact.ninja/fact](https://catfact.ninja/fact)
- Saves those facts in a local SQLite database using a standalone script
- Exposes them through a FastAPI backend
- Displays and submits facts via a React frontend

## 🐍 Part 1: Python Script – `import_cat_facts.py`

Create a Python script that:
1. Fetches 5 cat facts from `https://catfact.ninja/fact`
2. Extracts the `"fact"` field from each response
3. Saves the facts to a local SQLite database
   - Avoid inserting duplicates
   - Print a message for each inserted or skipped fact

### SQLite Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE cat_facts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    fact TEXT UNIQUE,
    created_at DATE DEFAULT (DATE('now'))
);
```

Run the script with:
```bash
python import_cat_facts.py
```

---

## ⚙️ Part 2: FastAPI Backend – `main.py`

Create a FastAPI app that connects to the SQLite database and exposes:

### `GET /catfacts`
Returns all cat facts in the DB:
```json
[
  { "id": 1, "fact": "Cats sleep 70% of their lives.", "created_at": "2024-04-02" },
  ...
]
```

### `GET /catfacts/random`
Returns a random cat fact:
```json
{ "fact": "Cats can rotate their ears 180 degrees." }
```

### `POST /catfacts`
Accepts a new cat fact via form data (`fact=...`) and inserts it into the database:
- Return a message if it's a duplicate or invalid

### ⚠️ CORS Setup
Your backend **must** support CORS to allow requests from your frontend:
```python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # You can limit this to http://localhost:3000 if preferred
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

Run the backend with:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

---

## ⚛️ Part 3: React Frontend

Set up a basic React app however you like (Vite, Create React App, etc). It should:

- Fetch and display all cat facts from `GET /catfacts`
- Provide a form to submit a new fact to `POST /catfacts`

Styling is not required — focus on working functionality.

## ✅ Project Checklist

- [ ] `import_cat_facts.py` fetches and stores 5 unique facts
- [ ] SQLite DB and schema created programmatically
- [ ] FastAPI backend with all three endpoints
- [ ] CORS enabled on the backend
- [ ] React frontend fetches and displays data
- [ ] React form can submit a new fact
